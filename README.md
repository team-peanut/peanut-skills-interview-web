<h1>Peanut - Skills Interview</h1>
</div>

## Welcome

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. As developers, we've taken technical tests before, and understand what a chore they can be, so we've designed this to allow you to show as much of your process as you'd like.

If you have any feedback on the exercise itself, feel free to email it to james[@]teampeanut.com
<br/><br/>

## Prerequisites.

You should have `node` and `pnpm` installed. You should fork this project into a private repo and, when ready, at james[@]teampeanut.com and nicolas[@]teampeanut.com to that repo.

This project shell is set up `create-react-app` with `react v18.2` `react-router-dom 6.12.0`. You are welcome to add any other packages or tools you feel help solve the problem and show us your best side.

The API is simulated through [mocktoon](https://mockoon.com/) file in the root of the project (`mockoon.json`).

<br/><br/>
